## ⚠️ Github README + `starter-s25.ipynb`

We strongly recommend reviewing each question on this github README page before you start following the directions for the corresponding question in `starter-s25.ipynb`. 

## Section 1: EDA & Feature Engineering

Concepts: Plotting, correlations, data imputation, leakage, one-hot encoding.

---

**Please perform the following preprocessing steps before you get started with answering the questions.**

- Merge the test and train dataset.
- Save this new dataframe as `merged_df`.

### Analyzing the feature: Transactions (Correlations and average trends)

**Q1. Left join `merged_df` to `transaction` and then print the *Spearman Correlation* between total sales and transactions average for a particular store on a particular date. [0.1 points]**

1. Start by performing the left join on `date` & `store_nbr`. Explore the result from this step before you proceed to the next step.
2. Group `merged_df` on `date` & `store_nbr` to compute total sales and transactions average.

**Q2. Plot an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) trendline between transactions and sales to verify the spearman correlation value computed in Q1 using `plotly`. [0.1 points]**

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Make sure all plots have correct axes labeling, title, legend (depending on whether the plot requires a legend). Lack of identifying descriptions on your plot will lead to loss of points.

Save the  plot as `q2.html` using the following instructions:
- After creating your fig, use:
```
fig.write_html("/kaggle/working/plot_name.html")
```

<img src="assets/html_download.png" width="auto" height="400">

- Go to the “Output” section on the right sidebar.
- Click the HTML file to download it.
- Create a directory called `answers` in your github repository and push the plot `html` files into the `answers` directory.

**Q3. Plot these **line** charts in the notebook using `plotly`: [0.3 points]**

1. Transactions vs Date (all stores color coded in the same plot) - this line plot is meant to be challenging to read!
2. Average monthly transactions
3. Average Transactions on the days of the week

Save the plots as `q3a.html`, `q3b.html`, and `q3c.html` respectively following the same instructions as for Q2. Make sure to push your plot `html` files to the `answers` directory.

**Requirements:**

1. X-axis should only display years (2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017) for plot A. Month for plot B and days of the week for plot C.
2. A, B and C are all single plots.

---

### Analyzing the feature: Oil (Data Imputation, Correlation can be deceptive)

**Q4. Use pandas' in-build (linear) interpolation to impute the missing oil values then plot (using `plotly`) an overlay of the imputed feature over the original. [0.1 points]**

**Requirements**:
- Make sure to use appropriate colors to your line plots so that the imputation vs the original feature is clearly visible.
- We recommend you to not use markers in your plot - that would make the lines more readable.
- This would be an example plot where legend would be required.

* Learn to use [NumPy's where](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.where.html) and [Pandas' interpolate](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.interpolate.html).

**Q5. Again, left join the interpolated oil values on the dataframe from Q1 and report the spearman correlation between `oil and sales` and `oil and transactions`. [0.1 points]**

- Use the hints from Q1
- Look at the resulting dataframe after the step 1. You're trying to get total sales and average transactions!

**Q6. Report the top-3 highest negative correlations between `oil and sales of a particular product family`. Now think about whether oil should be discarded as a feature. [0.1 points]**

* Always think intuitively as well: Oil should affect an oil-dependent country! The problem statement/dataset description also said that.
* Maybe not all products are affected by oil change. People still need to eat. So bread might not be affected so much!
* If correlation values don't align with your intuition or facts, maybe you're hypothesis or dataset view is wrong?

**Q7. Implement the One hot encode function for categorical columns (including `object` type). [0.1 points]** 

### Section 2: Statistical Models

**Recommendation:** Even though the assignment does not ask for plots. Visualizing the prediction helps build intuition.

**Q8. Make a submission using an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) model for each of the product families per store.**

* ```each of the product families per store``` means you will have to train 1782 models (should take ~7 mins to fit on CPU).
* Use the `make_submission` function to generate a csv file named as ```EMA_results.csv```.

Unlike Simple Moving Average and Cumulative Moving Average (concepts you should also be familiar with), Exponential Moving Average gives more weight to the recent observations and as a result of which, it can be a better model or better capture the movement of the trend (and is also faster).
(EMA's reaction is directly proportional to the jumps in data unlike other MA methods)

**Q9. What are PACF and ACF? Analyze the time series by plotting the ACF and PACF with lag 20 for total sales value per day.**

* Briefly describe the what the plots indicate and talk about the stationary nature of the data

**Q10. Perform the ADF test on the difference series for a valid ARIMA model. Then fit an ARIMA/SARIMA model with the appropriate p, d and q values. Make a submission.**

* Print the ADF statistic and corresponding p-value.
* Print the summary after fitting the model. (Should have Jarque-Bera, Ljung-Box, Heteroskedasticity, Skew and Kurtosis) $\rightarrow$ lookup what these tests mean!
* Are the MA and AR coefficients statistically signficant?
* Make predictions for next 15 days.
* Save the predictions as ```"ARIMA_results.csv"```. Do not use the make_submission function.

```
pred_df.to_csv("/kaggle/working/ARIMA_results.csv")
```

## Section 3: Gradient Boosted Tree Methods

**NOTE 1:** Do not worry/get hung up on Q12-14 trying to find the best hyperparameters by hit and trial. Q15 will show you a method that finds (sub) optimal hyperparamters automatically.

**NOTE 2:** You should be using all features so far except `id` for the subsequent submission questions.

**Q11. Define a validation set. What will be the most appropriate time period for this validation set?**

<details>
  <summary>
    Hint:
  </summary>
  <p>
    The validation set should ideally reflect the entire distribution of sales to make robust and generalizable models. However, since the test set is also biased towards a time-period here, the validation set should represent the test set well to achieve a lower metric score. <b>This is a big reason why models from Kaggle are often over-fitted and not deployable unless the competition hosts come up with extensive testing sets and/or metrics.</b>
  </p>
</details>


**Q12. Make a submission using LightGBM.**


**Q13. Make a submission using a CatBoost model.**


**Q14. Make a submission using an XGBoost model.**


**Q15. Use optuna for automatic hyperparameter optimization for your models in questions 10, 11 and 12  to achieve a lower RMSLE.**

* Recommendation: Try 10 trials for each method.

**Q16. Which out of the three Catboost vs LightGBM vs XGBoost provides the best score? Why do you think this model is more suited to this dataset/problem?**

#### [OPTIONAL] Does competition get the blood flowing for ya? 🤠 Then climb the ranks! Potential to earn extra credit*

*To earn *extra credit 💰*, achieve a *top-3 position* on the leaderboard. If your total score points is closer to a better letter grade, we'll use this ranking to boost the letter grade.

<details>
  <summary>
    Hint 1:
  </summary>
  <p> Having a solid/robust/represenatative of the underlying (true) distribution cross-validation set will help you more than you can imagine. Advice applicable till the end of times. </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    Hint 2:
  </summary>
  <p>Most Kaggle competitions are won by using an <b>ensemble</b> of methods. Try different variations! </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    Hint 3:
  </summary>
  <p>N-BEATS is a great deep learning based method. Try it out!</p>
